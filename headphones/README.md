Implement a design from scratch
headphones
Project Overview
This project is a complete implementation of a landing page for a headphone company, designed by Nicolas Philippot. The goal was to build a fully functional, pixel-perfect web page from scratch using HTML and CSS only. This project demonstrates knowledge of core web development concepts, including semantic HTML, CSS layout techniques, responsive design, and accessibility.

Project Tasks
HTML Structure: The HTML is built to be semantic and accessible, using appropriate tags for headings (h1, h2, h3), navigation (nav), sections (section), and lists (ul, ol). The structure is clean and logical to ensure readability and maintainability.
CSS Styling: All styling is handled with custom CSS. No external frameworks like Bootstrap were used. The design is meticulously recreated to match the provided Figma file, including colors, typography, spacing, and image placement.
Responsive Design: The page is fully responsive. It transitions to a mobile-friendly layout when the screen width is 480px or less. Media queries were used to adjust the layout, font sizes, and image displays for smaller screens, ensuring a great user experience on all devices.
Accessibility: The page is built with accessibility in mind.
Proper contrast ratios are used for text and background colors.
alt attributes are provided for all images.
Keyboard navigation is fully supported, and focus states are clearly visible.
Semantic HTML is used to provide a clear structure for screen readers.
Interactions: Interactive elements on the page, such as links and buttons, include hover and active states to provide visual feedback to the user.
Links (a): On hover/active, the color changes to #FF6565.
Buttons (button): On hover/active, the opacity is set to 0.9.
Technologies Used
HTML5: For the page structure and content.
CSS3: For all styling, including layout, colors, typography, and responsive design.
